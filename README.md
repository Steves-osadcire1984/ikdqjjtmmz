Just walked out of Ad Vitam. Wow, it’s like I’ve been to another planet and back. My back’s killing me from this cheap theater seat, but honestly, that's a minor squabble. The   — can’t even quite articulate this... It’s like if Jurassic rock formations had a baby with cyberpunk neon, birthed right there on the silver screen.

The noise in here was maddening – some kid chucked popcorn like confetti during a birth celebration and for a sec I thought I was stepping on fossils rather than crushed kernels. A guy next to me smelled like stale nachos, but I swear for a minute I was convinced it was the scent of eternity. Bizarre.

> That scene where they dive into the endless ocean — felt like staring into the abyss, or like when I peered into an empty quarry and just for a moment thought it was a portal. The visuals were so intense, my eyes still hurt, like they’ve witnessed the Big Bang.

The characters, all caught in that loop, living forever yet completely exhausted. Eternal life as a geology lecture with no end? There’s got to be some equation there I’m missing. Those crystals in that scene – glimmered like they’d harnessed the weight of millennia. I thought of dolomite or maybe some alien mineral we’ve yet to crush beneath our hammers.

I know you asked if you could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   – don’t even bother right now, my friend. This is more of a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   right in its total immersive chaos sort of thing. Even the soundtrack was offbeat, like listening to tectonic plates shifting beneath a synth.

God, I’m rambling. I need to sit somewhere quieter... like the center of a caldera.

Did you catch the part where technology and immortality wrap around each other like sedimentary layers of madness? Or was I seeing metaphors that weren’t there? I have no idea. My brain feels like it’s been through a rock crusher.

Anyway, gotta cut this short before I start typing lyrics to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds or something. Eternity looks alluring and dreadful all at once.
